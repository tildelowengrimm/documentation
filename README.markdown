This is a repository of non-code documentation, instructions, advice, suggestions, setups, tutorials, and other written material which I think will make it easier to get things right. It doesn't have much in it right now.

If you see a mistake, something that could be improved, or so on, please fix it and send a pull request! If you don't want to bother with the trouble of git, you could also send me an email.
